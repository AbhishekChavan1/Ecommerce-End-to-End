## 🔧 If You Want Automated Testing

While manual testing confirms everything works, if you want to set up Selenium automation later:

1. **Install ChromeDriver separately**: Download from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
2. **Add to PATH**: Place chromedriver.exe in your system PATH
3. **Run our Selenium tests**: They'll work once ChromeDriver is properly configured
